# Spotify Login Flow
## General Info
Creating "Log In" and "Sign In" pop-up pages for my previous Spotify App project.

## Problem
I need to implement the 2 screens below:
* [Log In Screen](https://static.authw.it/MS_-_Sprint_4_-_00_-_Page_Load.png)
* [Sign In Screen](https://static.authw.it/MS_-_Sprint_4_-_01_-_Page_Load.png)

The 1st pop-up will start with the "Log In," and after clicking the button, it will take you to the "Sign In."
That's where the user type in a username and password.

Requirements:
Username has to be greater than 6 characters.
Password has to be greater than 8 characters and contains a number.

When both requirements are met, and button is clicked, it will take you to the home page.  

## Process and Solution
I start off by looking at the 2 screens provided to me to figure out the proper layout.
I use Balsamiq to sketch out the wireframe designs for each page. It will be used as a guide before I can start coding.
On these pages, we also determine the color palette and styles they want me to include.

I use JIRA as my project management tool. It will help me with the flow, shows the number of tasks I have left, and keep me organize.

I collected the social media icons from iconfinder.com, because I wasn't able to grab them from the standard icons websites.

It was my first time using javascript for a project. I had to play around with the codes/variables/functions.
Tailwind CSS and MDN Wed Docs websites are very helpful. Issues that I ran into were coding the functions.

I made sure the pages are link correctly.
After completion, it was uploaded to GitHub and deployed on Vercel.
